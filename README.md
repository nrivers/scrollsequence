scrollsequence
==============

<p><strong>scrollsequence</strong> is an implementation that creates a flip book effect during page scroll. This isn't a complete plugin and requires strong knowledge of jQuery. Images included are for demonstration purposes only. I do not own rights to the video used. When loading you images you should do so in an asynchronous/non-blocking way. For demo purposes, this all happens on the main thread.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>jQuery 1.8+</p>

Features
--------
* Adds the images dynamically
* Binds image filenames to the location of the page scroll.
